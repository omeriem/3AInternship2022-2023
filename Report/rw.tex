\noindent\textbf{AI/ML Application for MDE.} The challenges in using Artificial Intelligence (or more precisely Machine Learning) in Model-Driven Engineering is due to the lack of datasets that the ML models can learn from. Even if the datasets are available, the heterogenous nature of the datasets specifically for the Internet of Things(IoT) technologies are delimiting the application of AI techniques in the domain. The learning granularity of the AI models needs to be fine-grained in order to obtain a more accurate and efficient learning.

The different notions of models in AI and MDE also brings some difficulty in integrating these two domain together. ML models or techniques as mentioned above are completely distinct than the models used in MDE; one is a statistical model while another is a structural model. Various works such as ML-Quadrat are looking forward to create a synergy between this models, allowing a more seamless model engineering in the domain.
